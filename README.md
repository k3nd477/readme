# Working with Kendall
Hello and welcome to the team! In addition to the responsibilities associated with your role, you and I (Kendall) are coworkers. This document is intended to ensure you are able to get the most from our working relationship. It attempts to capture my management philosophy, day-to-day work expectations, and other quirks with which you may wish to familiarize yourself. It is not a replacement for the actual working relationship we will develop over time, but is a useful document to check assumptions and hold me accountable.

It is in the spirit of similar documents from other leaders who have inspired.

## Guiding Principles

**Humans first.** I believe that people are the most important part of any company. I believe that people being seen and supported at work is a prerequisite to delivering great work. People are most satisfied when they are understood and valued. I will always make time to listen and work to ensure you are heard.

**Iteration and experimentation.** Things are not perfect now, but they'll only get better if we regularly reflect, give and accept feedback, and make small changes to everything continuously.

**Team first approach.** I believe that as we come together as a team and are sure to look out for our teammates health and success, we will all become better. I look for members of team seeking out opportunities to help and support one another.

**Leaders who do.** Leadership with domain expertise is important. I seek to lead from this point of view. If I do not have experience in a given area, I will seek to learn from you and grow in my understanding.

**Everyone can be a leader.** Leadership comes in many forms. While people managers are necessary when scaling organizations, I believe that no matter your title or role, you can provide leadership to a project, our team, and our company.  

## Day-to-day Operations

**1:1s.** I think there is great value in meeting regularly with each person on the team. You will ordinarily be operating asynchronously (with a fair amount of autonomy), but it is important that we occasionally synchronize. My expectation is that you will drive most of the agenda for our syncs. This meeting discusses topics of substance, not updates. Things like professional development, team dynamics, areas of growth, etc.

We'll meet once a week for 30 minutes (to start; we can adjust this as our working relationship evolves). I've created a collaborative document that only you and I can access which we'll use to shape the agenda of each 1:1. Any time a question, topic, or thought of substance comes to mind, put it in the doc. I will do the same.

**Communication.** There are many ways to communicate with people. I try to be aware and use the right means for the message: email is permanent, in-person and video conversations are ephemeral, and Slack is somewhere in between. I ask that you also be thoughtful with your communications.

**Meetings.** I'm in a lot of meetings. My expectation is that meetings have an agenda (or a goal with a plan for achieving that goal) in the scheduled time. I will ask for this from a meeting organizer before accepting an invitation. I encourage you to do the same. Before you book a meeting, think about whether or not you could achieve the same outcome using Slack or an email.

**Action.** I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. I value proactivity in all forms. If you see an opportunity to make a contribution, do it. I will always prefer you to take action rather than wait for someone else to do something.

**On the clock.** My philosophy on working hours is guided by the principles outlined above (happy people beget great work). I encourage you to optimize your work time, balancing the needs associated with your role, your customers, the team, and your happiness. Work with me as this balance evolves.

I will rarely send you an email or Slack message late in the evening or on a weekend. I don't expect you to respond outside of your normal work hours.

## Miscellany

**I crave learning.** I do not know everything, and until I do, I will continue to seek knowledge. I hope to learn from you.

**Improvisation.** I have spent a little bit of time studying and practicing improvisational comedy. It has taught me to say “Yes, and…” when interacting with people and problems.

**Drama.** While I love improv, I don’t like drama. I expect people to communicate clearly and not get bogged down in pettiness, politics, or drama.

**Negativity** takes the wind out of my sails. It is a fog that obscures the hard work energy that we bring to the team. Negativity prevents safety, innovation, and communication.  

**Direct.** I am a direct communicator. I am the type of person who likes to get to the point. I try to be thoughtful and take into account who I am communicating with to ensure what I say isn’t lost in how I said it.

**Empathy.** I believe that we are all doing our best on a daily basis. In my opinion, life is too short to tolerate unkindness. I expect team members to bring empathy to their interactions with teammates, colleagues, and customers.

**Illustrations.** I have been told that some of my illustrations are a bit off-the-beaten path. I try to use relevant illustrations to help make a point. If an illustration flops, just let me know it didn’t land. I’ll try again.

**How to best communicate.** You will get a more thoughtful response from me face to face where I can give you my undivided attention. Give me a heads up prior to our conversation and I can marinate in the question/issue.

If you need a prompt response from me, Slack is the best way. I use reminders and develop my To Do list from there. If you have specific time constraints, please note that when reaching out.

**Process.** I am a fan of process. I don’t like busy work or process for process's sake, but I think process provides clarity to all involved. If process becomes a barrier to productivity please call it out to me, I may not see it.

**I am informal.** I like to joke around and have fun. I also take my work very seriously. I view people leadership as an honor. I hope to continue to learn, grow and ultimately to live up to the task of leading this team.

This document evolves. I will update it from time to time and would appreciate your feedback.
